    <p>When I was in class 10th at that time in the last i gave the entrance exam of Abhyanand super 30 where i passed in all
    <br> the three rounds of entrance test and got a golden opportunity to study  for jee exam and qualify it. There was no cost
    <br> taken by students for there studies and in fact they also provide free lodging.
    <br> I worked hard there and atlast was able to qualify jee advanced exam in 2021 with all india rank 2818</p>
